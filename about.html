        <p class = "content"> Here at The Cagers Inc., we believe that Nicolas Cage makes <em>everything</em> better. Don't you agree? Well, if not, you're wrong.
            <br/><br/>
            Our mission is simple: to provide Cage products of terrible make for whatever possible reason or application our consumers want. Honesty, you could
            just go to Google and find some pretty bad (or good) Nicolas Cage products -- but you, our faithful consumer, has chosen to be here with us: The Cagers. 
            This goes to show that hard work rooted in memes can create a thing of beauty.  
            <br/><br/>
            If you don't belive us, just take a look at our handy little graph! This shows the average happiness of a person and what packages they order from us. 
            If for some reason you can't read graphs, just know it says that peak happiness is only obtained through buying our Deluxe package.
